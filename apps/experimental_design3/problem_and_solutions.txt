Bottleneck link queue size: 7, so optimal cwnd size is 7.

During slow start phase:

1. each received data opens cwnd by 1, and consumer sends out 2
   Interests in response.

2. by the time when cwnd = 7, consumer continues to grow its value and
   remain in the slow start phase

It seems that the connection can never reach equilibrium state. Is it
because of RTT/RTO calculation?

Proposed solution:
